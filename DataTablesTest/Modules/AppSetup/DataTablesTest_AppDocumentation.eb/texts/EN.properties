Txt2WRWm3=Firstly, let's understand the SCSS files that define our app's style. You'll find them under <strong>Modules/Shared/Client/SCSS/</strong>. The most important file is <strong>style.scss</strong> because it imports the other SCSS it needs from other files, and brings it all together along with some CSS of its own. It's this file that we compile to get our final CSS stylesheet.
Txt2WRWm3_10=Sometimes your users will forget their passwords, so we've included a secure password reset function too. Clicking "Forgot your password" will email a user a link to enter a new password.
Txt2WRWm3_11=On the Menus page you'll see a list of the existing menus in the system including <strong>TOP</strong>, which is the menu that appears in the header of every page. The other menus appear as sub-menus of the TOP menu. The overall structure of the menu system can be maintained via the Menu Entries page.
Txt2WRWm3_12=On the Menu Entries form you can define the structure of your menu. Each row defines the parent menu for either a sub-menu or a menu item.
Txt2WRWm3_13=Finally, we use the Visible Menu Items page to define which <strong>roles</strong> can view which <strong>menu items</strong>. This is how you control which groups of users have access to the different parts of your app, see <a href\="\#" onclick\="gotoPage('Security')">Security</a>.
Txt2WRWm3_14=The Menu Items page lists the clickable items in all of the menus. Each item has an "action", which is the target URL when the item is clicked. You'll see the existing menu items mostly go to <strong>[formName].eb</strong> where [formName] is the name of a form in your project.
Txt2WRWm3_15=You'll also notice that some of the menu items have a "style", which is used to add icons to the left of a menu item, eg. <i class\="fas fa-home"></i> Home. The values, eg. <code>fa fa-home</code>, are FontAwesome classes. You can find the full library of available FontAwesome icons <a href\="https\://fontawesome.com/icons?d\=gallery&m\=free">here</a>.
Txt2WRWm3_16=For example, the first four rows in this table define the four elements that appear in the <strong>TOP</strong> menu, ie. the <strong>Home</strong> item, the <strong>Documentation</strong> item and then the <strong>Product</strong> and <strong>Admin</strong> menus. The <strong>order </strong> column defines the order that they appear in on the screen.
Txt2WRWm3_17=We've included a form called <strong>DataTablesTest_DataInitialisation</strong> that sets up the data for the user security and menu systems. This form runs in the background whenever the DataTablesTest_Home or DataTablesTest_AppDocumentation forms are executed, using a <strong>Before Form</strong> script called <strong>callDataInit</strong>. We recommend that you remove the data initialisations scripts before you deploy to production.
Txt2WRWm3_18=For information on how to add a new page to the menu, see <a href\="\#" onclick\="gotoPage('Using_the_Menu')">Using the Menu</a>. The URL "action" for <strong>DataTablesTest_About</strong>, for example, would be <strong>DataTablesTest_About.eb</strong>.
Txt2WRWm3_19=Next, you just need to take a copy of an existing form that you want to base your new form on. For this example, you'd copy the contents of the <strong>Home</strong> folder (that is, the  DataTablesTest_Home form and the Scripts folder) and paste it inside your new <strong>About</strong> folder.
Txt2WRWm3_2=<strong>Style.scss</strong> also contains a line to import a font for your app. We recommend <a href\="https\://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>. You can simply replace the URL in line 6 of style.scss with a font URL of your choice, for example, <code>https\://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family\=Roboto</code>. Then you'll need to use your newly imported font as a value of a <code>font-family</code> property or an appropriate Bootstrap variable.
Txt2WRWm3_20=Say, for example, you wanted to create an <em>about</em> page for your app. First, you'd need to add a new folder to the <strong>Modules</strong> folder and call it <strong>About</strong>.
Txt2WRWm3_21=You could also redefine the meaning of red by changing the value of <code>$red</code> (around line 42) to any css colour value\!
Txt2WRWm3_3=If you want to change things like spacing, fonts and colours just adjust the variables in <strong>_bootstrapVariables.scss</strong>. You can change any variable in the long list that Bootstrap uses when compiling its CSS. For example, try changing the value of <code>$primary</code> to <code>$red</code> (around line 66) to change the button and header colour to Bootstrap's predefined red.
Txt2WRWm3_4=Before any of our changes take effect, we need to recompile the CSS from the new SCSS. The easiest tool for doing this is called <a href\="http\://koala-app.com/">Koala</a>. Download and install Koala, click the plus to add a new folder to Koala's watch list and select the <strong>SCSS</strong> folder in your StarterApp project. Now you'll see the <strong>style.scss</strong> and <strong>style.css</strong> files in the middle section of the app, click <strong>style.scss</strong> and then <strong>compile</strong> in the right hand panel. Done\!
Txt2WRWm3_5=Even better, make sure <strong>Auto Compile</strong> is ticked and then every time you save a change to <strong>style.scss</strong> or any of the files it imports, it will automatically recompile. We'd also recommend selecting <strong>Autoprefix</strong> and setting the Output Style to <strong>compressed</strong>.
Txt2WRWm3_6=New users create accounts by clicking the Sign up link in the dropdown login box. They'll need to provide their name, a valid email address and a password at least 8 characters long. User security really matters, so passwords are encrypted using the Verj.io <a href\="http\://hub.verj.io/ebase/doc/form_parameter_encryption.htm">Encryption Services</a>.
Txt2WRWm3_7=You can maintain the users in your system using the <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Roles</strong> and <strong>User Roles</strong> pages under the Admin menu. Roles control the menu access for different groups of users. For more information about making menu items visible to different roles, see <a href\="\#" onclick\="gotoPage('Using_the_Menu')">Using the Menu</a>.
Txt2WRWm3_8=Users can log in using the Login button in the top right hand corner. There are three users already in the system, Ann (role\: Admin), Mike (role\: Manager) and Sarah (role\: Staff). Their usernames and passwords are their names, eg. mike/mike. Why not try logging in as each and seeing how the menu changes.
Txt2WRWm3_9=New users are required to validate their email address before they can log in. We've provided a verjSamples email account that you can use for free when you are developing and testing.

Txt2oKF5U_5=So, how do I build my app?
Txt3DQTDR=The file we haven't mentioned is <strong>_verjioUtilities.scss</strong>. This just contains some useful extensions to Bootstrap's utility classes. If you understand the way Bootstrap uses breakpoints in its classes to adjust styling then you should understand these classes as well.
Txt3DQTDR_2=Lastly, you rename the pasted form to <strong>DataTablesTest_About</strong>, open it and start designing your new page.

Txt6VIJwV=This starter app uses Bootstrap 4 for layout and styling so applying colour, spacing etc. uses utility classes from the Bootstrap framework. Bootstrap stylesheets are written in SCSS and compiled into CSS. This means that changing the theme of your app is as simple as changing a few variables and recompiling the CSS, all of which we'll cover here. It's easy\!
Txt6VIJwV_2=Security is important. We've got you covered\!
Txt6VIJwV_3=The menu at the top of this app is dynamically built based on who's logged in, giving you the flexibility to decide who can see what. Here are a few instructions for how to modify the menu to match your own app structure.
Txt6VIJwV_4=Building out your Starter App is really easy.
